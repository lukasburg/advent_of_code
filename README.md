## Solutions for advent of code by me

This repo contains my solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2022.

Mostly I tried to:

* "code golf" (write solutions with as little bytes of code as possible)
* use functional programming a lot
  (the puzzles are until now always given as a list of inputs, so using functional solutions seems natural) 
* sometimes I challenged myself to use some other paradigm, just to have some diversity
